# BulkBuddy
This application serves as an online fitness community, with the purpose of tracking progress, setting challenges and comparing your progress and stats with your friends.  
## Specification Deliverable

### Key Features

### Technologies
* HTML and CSS - Create the user interface. Design the layout, buttons, and overall presentation of pages offered in the app (login, home, friends).
* JavaScript - Implement the behavior of the application. This includes handling user interactions, updating the UI in real-time, and sending/receiving data to/from the server.
* Service - Create a backend service using a server-side technology, with endpoints for logging in, retrieving progress and max stats, as well as challenges given by users.
* Websocket - Enable real-time communication between the server and clients. This is crucial for updating the UI in real-time as stats are recorded.
* React - Builds front end components, allowing a better user interface, with updates recieved through websockets. 

## HTML Deliverable
I worked on the application structure and some of the formatting for this deliverable.
* **HTML pages** - 4 html pages, one for the login, one for the home, one for viewing friends scores, and one for seeing challenges.
* **Links** - There is a nav menu when logged in that will take you to two separte pages for friends and challenges.
* **Text** - Descriptions of your maxes as well as your frineds are outlined in text, which are editable, and same with the challenges set.
* **Images** - I added an image of a dumbbell to the front page to show an idea of the icon.
* **Login** - Input box and login button for this.
* **Database** - Collection of users maxes that can be displayed as friends. 
* **Websocket** - real time updating for challenges set and challenges made.

## CSS Deliverable 
I worked on the styling I put in place during the HTML deliverable. This is a more final form of how I want my application to look. I split the work I had done before, off of the index.html and made its own css file that is used by link.

* **Navigation elements** - Fixed the coloring on my various navigation bars, and I made the login box circular. 
* **Responsive to window resizing** - Looks good on all devices and all sizes of screen.
* **Application elements** - made it very simple but effective in holding attention. 
* **Application text content** - I changed my overall font, sizing and some spacing as well, to achieve a more custom feel.
* **Application images** - I made sure my images would blend well in the background, and not cover anything up.

## JavaScript Deliverable
I created placeholders for future WebSocket technology, and I added more JavaScript for the application to work for a single user. 
* **Login** - After you enter your username and click login, it will direct you to the home page displaying your username.
* **Database** - Data for your own personal maxes, and the challenges that are simulated to be pulled in real time, are stored in local storage, but will be replaced later. 
* **WebSocket** - I created a script for Challenges.html to periodically generate mock challenges, to simulate real time additions by friends. This will be replaced later by a websocket Function. And these will be stored in Database in the future for navigation purposes.
* **Application Logic** - The Personal max Boxes now work, with you being able to edit them, and stored in local storage for you to come back to. I wanted to do the same for editing and publishiing your own personal challenges, but time got the better of me and I will add that function later. 

## Service Deliverable
I added backend endpoints to handle login requests. 
* **Node.js/Express HTTP Service** - Done
* **Static Middleware for Frontend** - Done
* **Third Party Endpoints** - Not Done
* **Backend Service Endpoints** - Example login set that will store current user on Server
* **Frontend Calls** -
